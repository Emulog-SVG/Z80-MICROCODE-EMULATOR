
In order to pass Q:

 ALU never use F53, F<>FLG loads done via HBUS(VBUS) latch
 Bits 53 are leftout from data passage
 Every legal aluop has defined state action, so set DSA flag with that
 Each new M1 cycle copy and reset DSA to ASA flag
 Each CCF and SCF check - if ASA then COPY F53 else OR F53
 CCF and SCF set DSA like normal aluop.

In order to pass LDXX and CPXX, interrupted quirk

 Both single and repeated versions 
 have ending overlapped aluop like inside LD R,R
 First nibble of ALUA and ALUB added and 
 written twice to low and high nibble of HBUS so F53=F13
 ALUA is A that loaded ad ADDER=IR stage
 ALUB is DLATCH value via LBUS

In order to pass INXX and OUTX/OTXX  :

 All IO in range 00FE to FFFE must be &HBF
 Affection is 3-stage, and PV behavior like this :
 First is DEC B, second is erratic ADD, last affect PV
 INIR use Z of WZ, and OTIR use L of HL to load ALU with
 INIR read port to DLATCH, 
 OTIR write to port value of (HL) via DLATCH
 First is ALUA(Z or L)+ALUB(DLATCH)>HBUS set NCH
 Next is HBUS>ALUA corruption that truncate it like AND &B00000111
 Last is ALUA XOR ALUB(B) and PV is this
