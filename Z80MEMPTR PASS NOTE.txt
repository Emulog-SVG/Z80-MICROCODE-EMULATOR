Z80MEMPTR by Patrik Rak note:

In order to pass OUTI group,another quirk need to be done.

As stated about inir/otir : Quote:

	S,Z,5,3 are affected by DEC B.
	The N flag is a copy of bit 7 of the last value read from/written to the I/O port.
		(since these values pass via latch "T" in Z80, N equals its MSB)  
	The C and H flag is set as follows : Take register C, add one to it
	if the instruction increases HL otherwise decrease it by one. 
		(on cycle 9 of these opcodes Z80 set addr bus with BC, 
		 and same signals write BC to ADDER, on cycle 10 ADDER 
		 perform increase/decrease And write result To WZ/MEMPTR,
		 so mentioned C+1 is actually Z of WZ)
	Now, add the the value of the I/O port (read or written) to it, (latch "T")
	and the carry of This last addition is copied to the C and H flag

So, all that is true for INIR group, 
but OUTI group needs to be register L supplied instead of Z
The microcode that set up WZ state is same for INIR/OTIR, as in Visual Z80 Remix

Is the test buggy or the latter hint, who knows.
